**Festes de Poble is a mobile application made with React Native, using the power of Hooks, that lets you navigate all the events of small towns around my birthplace,
so you don't need to depend on paper anymore.**

_2020 Update : It is an "old" project that I expect to rewrite soon, for a more modern code, with latest practices
(Hooks, Context) you could check my blog https://github.com/jvidalv/react-vvlog_
### As it core

Build with ðŸ”¥ Expo and React.useState, also:

- react-navigation

Mention to all my family that tested the app â™¥. 

### The data

All the data (Events and towns) come from my backend `https://www.fempoble.app`.

It is a classic backend that lets you introduce the data graphically, so anyone, without any kind of tech
experience could write all the information of their town.

You can check the source code of it here `https://github.com/jvidalv/yii2-old-fempoble`, anyway I planning
to move it all to VVADMIN, and make fempoble a module of it.
